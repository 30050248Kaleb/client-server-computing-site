            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
              Preact is a lightweight framework developed by Jason Miller as a
              smaller, more performant alternative to React (Eluwande, 2019).
              React is one of the biggest most widely used SPA technologies
              other than Angular, so if Preact is just React but faster, it's a
              good alternative to React. Preact also lets you use standard HTML
              tag attributes like "class", where in react, you have to learn the
              JSX syntax and use "className" instead. The JSX syntax is still
              acceptable, as you can install a React compatibility plugin so you
              don't have to migrate as many things when moving from React to
              Preact.
            </p>
            <h3>How it works</h3>
            <p>
              The entry point for Preact is template.html, which has ejs tags to
              insert things like the page title and ones to append things at the
              end of the head and body of the page. The index.js just exports
              the app.js inside of the components folder. The structure of the
              App component is a constant variable called App which points to an
              unnamed function, this is called a functional component. The
              starter app for Preact has the Preact Router already imported,
              with the home component and two copies of the profile component
              with different parameters routed to whether a user is supplied in
              the URL. Since the home component is routed to "/", it is loaded
              by default. The file for the home component is in the routes
              folder, however where in React, it would usually be called
              home.js, it's a file called index.js inside of a home folder
              (which is in the routes folder).
            </p>
            <p>
              This is not how I would structure my SPA, but you can also have
              named JS files outside of their own folders, showing how Preact
              works for you, instead of the other way around.

          <h3>Strengths and Weaknesses</h3>
          <p></p>
          <h4>Strengths</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Preact is a lightweight framework, so it's faster than React,
                which is an important design philosophy of SPAs.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Preact is based off of React, so the syntax is either the same
                or similar, and is compatible with React.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Preact uses a virtual DOM, which is faster than a real DOM.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                The starter app for Preact has many features demonstrated, such
                as the router and the use of props.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Since Preact is developed to be React but smaller and faster, it
                can't deviate/innovate too far from React else it can't be
                called an alternative to it (Dhaduk, 2022).
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Preact might not be as suitable for large scale applications,
                where the full processing power of React is needed.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Preact is not as popular as React, so there is less support for
                it, and less documentation and tutorials for it.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
