            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
              Preact is a lightweight framework developed by Jason Miller as a
              smaller, more performant alternative to React (Eluwande, 2019).
              React is one of the biggest most widely used SPA technologies
              other than Angular, so if Preact is just React but faster, it's a
              good alternative to React. Preact also lets you use standard HTML
              tag attributes like "class", where in react, you have to learn the
              JSX syntax and use "className" instead. The JSX syntax is still
              acceptable, as you can install a React compatibility plugin so you
              don't have to migrate as many things when moving from React to
              Preact.
            </p>
            <h3>How it works</h3>
            <p>
              The entry point for Preact is template.html, which has ejs tags to
              insert things like the page title and ones to append things at the
              end of the head and body of the page. The index.js just exports
              the app.js inside of the components folder. The structure of the
              App component is a constant variable called App which points to an
              unnamed function, this is called a functional component. The
              starter app for Preact has the Preact Router already imported,
              with the home component and two copies of the profile component
              with different parameters routed to whether a user is supplied in
              the URL. Since the home component is routed to "/", it is loaded
              by default. The file for the home component is in the routes
              folder, however where in React, it would usually be called
              home.js, it's a file called index.js inside of a home folder
              (which is in the routes folder).
            </p>
            <p>
              This is not how I would structure my SPA, but you can also have
              named JS files outside of their own folders, showing how Preact
              works for you, instead of the other way around.

          <h3>Strengths and Weaknesses</h3>
          <p></p>
          <h4>Strengths</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Preact is a lightweight framework, so it's faster than React,
                which is an important design philosophy of SPAs.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Preact is based off of React, so the syntax is either the same
                or similar, and is compatible with React.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Preact uses a virtual DOM, which is faster than a real DOM.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                The starter app for Preact has many features demonstrated, such
                as the router and the use of props.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Since Preact is developed to be React but smaller and faster, it
                can't deviate/innovate too far from React else it can't be
                called an alternative to it (Dhaduk, 2022).
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Preact might not be as suitable for large scale applications,
                where the full processing power of React is needed.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Preact is not as popular as React, so there is less support for
                it, and less documentation and tutorials for it.
              </p>

          <h3>Example Web App</h3>
          <p>
            For the test site for Preact, I wanted to make something more
            complex, since I use React for my own personal site. When I loaded
            up the starter app, I noticed it had profile pages. That insipired
            me to make a super basic Twitter clone. Preact was easy to
            understand, but that may be due to my history with React.
          </p>
          <p>
            The site I made has a home page and a profile page which is a
            template for a user's profile. I used ChatGPT to generate some JSON
            files for some users and posts linked to users by their username.
            After a few iterations of getting it to change some things in the
            JSONs, it started going haywire so I took over and fixed up the
            flaws in the files. The index.js points directly to the app.js to
            render, which was placed in the components folder and I didn't move
            it, however, I did change the views from a folder with an index.js
            for each of them to a Javascript file with unique names, as I was
            having trouble telling them apart. I used app.js to set up the
            framework of the site, adding a header which has a navigation bar,
            the sidebar which has your profile picture, name and friends, and
            the main content in the middle.
          </p>
          <p>
            I won't go into the details of the entire site, but for the profile
            page, I hard coded the username of the currently logged in user to
            one of the users from the JSON. I then used the username to find the
            user inside of the user JSON to get an instance of it that I can use
            to check if the profile currently viewed is on the logged in user's
            friends list or if it is the user. The username of the currently
            viewed profile is passed into the URL as a parameter, which is then
            used to find the user in the JSON. The profile contains a cover
            photo (which doesn't change between users), a profile picture, the
            user's name, username handle, friends list and their posts. The
            posts are generated by passing a post object from the posts JSON to
            a component I created called Post. The component creates a bootstrap
            card that looks like a tweet, with the poster's name, username,
            profile picture, the post's content and the time it was posted. To
            get how long it had been since it was posted, I asked ChatGPT to
            create a script which calculated it. It used fancy logic which I
            didn't fully understand, but it was not my main focus, so I just
            used it as is. I realised the posts in the JSON were ordered from
            oldest to newest, which made it easy to sort, as I just had to
            reverse the order when mapping the posts to the Post component.
