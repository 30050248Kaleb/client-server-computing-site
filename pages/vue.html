            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
              Vue is a simplistic framework that known for it's small learning
              curve and use single fingle components. Vue, and the front-end
              build tool Vue uses, Vite was created by Evan You (You, n.d.).
            </p>
            <h3>How it works</h3>
            <p>
              Vue uses views and components to display data. The entry point is
              index.html, which has a script tag linked to the main.js file. The
              main.js file builds app.vue which is a single file component, this
              means that it can the template (the HTML to display, surrounded in
              template tags) and include CSS and TypeScript/JavaScript specific
              to that component. Vue has RouterView and RouterLink tags to
              define where the views are positioned in the base app.vue
              component and to display links that will navigate the RouterView
              to a specified view. The HTML in the components are inside of
              template tags, which Vue converts into optimized JavaScript.

          <h3>Strengths and Weaknesses</h3>
          <p></p>
          <h4>Strengths</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Due to the creator of Vue being Chinese, it has quality
                documentation in Chinese (Cromwell, 2017).
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Vue uses a virtual DOM, which is faster than a real DOM.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Vue is easy to learn and has a small learning curve.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Vue is less known than other frameworks like React and Angular,
                so there it has a smaller community.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Vue doesn't have a built-in state manager, so you have to use a
                third party library like Vuex or Pinia.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>

                Vue doesn't have a built-in router, so you have to use a third
                party library like Vue Router.

          <h3>Example Web App</h3>
          <p>
            Vue was fairly simple to understand, as it's default app came with
            the Vue Router set up. I had to untangle the mess that was the home
            page, which was split into many components. I made a site that has a
            home page, an about page and a page to display The Beatle's albums
            from a JSON I found online. A lot of the syntax I used regarding the
            props and JSON I had to look up, with many of the examples online
            being dissimilar to each other.
          </p>
          <p>
            As seen below, (unfortunately in alphabetical order) App.vue
            contains a site heading and navigation bar, and the RouterView tag
            which displays the content of the selected view. index.js contains
            the routes for the views. The home page is the default view, and the
            about page and albums page are set to a path, which is "lazily"
            loaded to only load when it is viewed, which is faster than loading
            all the pages at once, and a good feature for large-scale
            applications. The home and about pages have minimal content, but the
            albums page uses a component called Album.vue to generate an image
            with some text for each album, and the data is pulled from the JSON
            file and looped through to generate each album.
          </p>
          <p>
            It took a long time to make the default export for the Album.vue
            component. At first I only had the return part at the top, then the
            created part and finally to get it working, props. The div has a
            data-tilt attribute because I was trying to import tilt.js through
            script tags, but gave up when it stopped working.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some of the conventions such as when you are binding data to an
            element's attribute, you have to put a colon before the name, and
            use quotes to reference the data, but when you are binding data to
            the content of an element such as a paragraph's text, you use double
            curly braces.
