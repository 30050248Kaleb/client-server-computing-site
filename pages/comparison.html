          <h3>Evaluation of each framework</h3>
          <p>
            Below is an evaluation of each framework based on the following
            criteria: ease of use, performance, community support, learning
            curve, popularity, and scalability in the context of SPA development.
          </p>
          <h4>Angular</h4>
          <p>Angular is difficult due to it's complexity, however after the initially big learning curve, it can be fairly easy to understand. Angular is a very popular framework, used in major sites you could be using in your daily life like: Gmail, the Google Play Store, The Guardian and Weather.com to name a few (Patel, 2023). Angular seems setup in a way that has large-scale apps in mind, with the compartmentalisation of all of it features.</p>
          <h4>Aurelia</h4>
          <p>Aurelia is really easy to use, this is mainly because of the simplicity of the jargon and formatting, it stays fairly true to HTML and JavaScript. It has a small learning curve, which isn't to say there isn't one at all, however I found it the easiest framework to grasp in a short amount of time. Aurelia isn't very popular, I couldn't find any major sites that are built with it.</p>
          <h4>Ember</h4>
          <p>Ember is difficult to use, unless you do extensive research into the jargon it use. The learning curve is fairly steep, as you don't have to learn TypeScript, but you do need to know how to use Handlebars. Ember is quite popular, it is used to build the PlayStation Now, Apple Music and Vine sites to name a few (Built With Ember, n.d.).</p>
          <h4>Preact</h4>
          <p>Preact is pretty simple to understand. It is known to be fast, as it is essentially a minified version of React. According to Preact themselves, popular sites like DailyMotion, Lyft and Uber are using Preact (Preact, n.d.). It is built in a way that supports scalability, suitable for any size of app.</p>
          <h4>Svelte</h4>
          <p>Svelte is known for it's simplicity and ease of use, making it a good recommendation for a beginner. Svelte is not used in many big name sites, but one big name site that uses it is TeamSpeak (Best of Svelte, n.d.).</p>
          <h4>Vue</h4>
          <p>Popular sites like Behance, Nintendo, Gitlab and Chess.com have used Vue. (Shah, 2019)</p>

          <h3>Recommended Framework</h3>
          <p>
            Based on the research conducted in this assignment, the recommended
            framework for SPA development is Thing. This is because: reason 1,
            reason 2 and reason 3.
