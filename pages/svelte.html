            <h3>What is Client-Server Computing</h3>
            <p>
              According to Motiso (2022), "A client-server model is a networking
              computing system design that illustrates a relationship between
              two or more computers, where the client computers request and
              receive services or resources from a powerful centralized server
              computer" (Motiso, 2022, para 3)
            </p>
            <p>See Figure 1 for a visual example of Client-Server Computing.</p>
            <p>
              Client-Server Computing distributes tasks between the client and a
              daemon (a computer designed to only run server side tasks). The
              client sends a request for information and the server returns a
              response. This allows many clients to connect to a website and
              send requests to a central server.

          <h3>Uses of Client-Server Computing</h3>
          <p>
            Client-Server Computing has many uses, such as Web Servers, Email
            Servers and File Servers. This is because they allow the data to be
            stored on the server while clients
          </p>

        <section>
          <h3>Why has Client-Server Computing evolved</h3>
          <p>
            There are many reasons Client-Server Computing has evolved, a few of
            them are:
          </p>

          <h4>Increase in Network Speeds</h4>
          <p>
            The increase in network speeds has means that the client and server
            can request and respond much faster. This has also changed how
            content
          </p>

          <h4>Scalability</h4>
          <p>
            The fact that the Client-Server model only has to scale on the
            server side to handle the capacity of users means it can be easily
            adapted.
          </p>

          <h4>Advancing in computer resources</h4>
          <p>
            As computers have become increasingly complex and interconnected,
            the Client-Server model has become widely adopted. Clients aren't
            just "dumb terminals" anymore and can process a fair amount of data.
            There are different styles of Client-Server Computing, such as Thick
            and Thin Client Computing.

          <h3>
            Advantages and Disadvantages of different client-server
            architectures
          </h3>
          <p>
            Thick Client Computing is a style of Client-Server Computing in
            which the client does most of the processing and data storage
            client-side. This is makes the computing feel responsive and have
            better capability with a limited network connection. However it
            isn't recommended for mobile or remote clients, as they aren't as
            powerful.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thin Client Computing is another style of Client-Server Computing
            that relys mainly on the server to process data and

        <h2>Single Pages Applications (SPAs)</h2>
        <section>
          <h3>What is a SPA</h3>
          <p>
            A Single Page Application (SPA) is a type of website that consists
            of only one page, and the content is dynamically generated when you
            interact with the page.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>History and Philosophy of SPAs</h3>
          <p></p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>How they work</h3>
          <p>
            SPAs use a base webpage to load a html page the app with use and
            then injects components into the parts of page typically using
            javascript.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>How they differ from traditional web development</h3>
          <p>
            Traditional web development usually consists of designing a site
            page by page, which can have you copy and pasting elements like the
            navigation bar into every page, so when you go to modify it, you
            have to change every instance of it. Whereas with SPA development,
            you can create a navigation bar in a component and then reference it
            where you need it, so when you need to modify it, you only have to
            update the component.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Techhnologies SPAs make use of</h3>
          <p>
            Erwin states that underlying technologies that SPAs use like URLs
            are often artificially injected by the browser's History API; this
            seems like a hybrid state instead of a long term solution. The
            concept of URLs makes sense for document-based websites, but needs
            to be rethought from the perspective of SPAs. If not taken care of,
            simple features like the forward and back buttons can break the app,
            resulting in a bad user experience (Erwin, 2021).
