        <h2>Svelte</h2>
        <section style="display: flex; gap: 2rem">
          <div>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
              Svelte is a component framework built by Rich Harris. Svelte is
              different to most other frameworks, because instead of "diffing"
              the DOM, it compiles your code into efficent code that directly
              manipulates the DOM (Harris, 2019).
            </p>
            <h3>How it works</h3>
            <p>
              When trying out Svelte, I went to their website, which had an
              interactive tutorial to learn how Svelte's single file components
              work. I found this to be very helpful.
            </p>
            <p>
              I installed the default app from their website, which looked
              nothing like what I had just been learning, so I had to research
              into why there was pages that begun with plus symbols. It turns
              out they are how Svelte knows which components are routable. The
              pages don't have to be added to a list of routes anywhere, they're
              automatically picked up by the plus prefix, and then you can just
              navigate to the folder's path. The default Svelte app's entry
              point is app.html, which is in the src folder, the content of the
              body is injected into a div in the body specified by a Svelte
              variable called %sveltekit.body%.
            </p>
            <p>
              The components can have a script, style and HTML section, allowing
              for the HTML, CSS and JavaScript to be in the same file. The style
              is scoped to the component, so it doesn't affect the rest of the
              page, which can be useful if you don't live by the philosophy of
              reusing styles across components. When you reference a component,
              it looks like a custom HTML tag with the properties passed in as
              attributes.

          <h3>Strengths and Weaknesses</h3>
          <p></p>
          <h4>Strengths</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Svelte is a compiler, which means that it can be faster than a
                framework that uses a virtual DOM (Harris, 2019).
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Svelte is small, and it is easy to learn.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Components can have their own style, which is scoped to the
                component.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Routed components are automatically picked up, so you don't have to add them to a list of routes.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Referenced components are structured like HTML tags, which makes
                it easy to understand.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                The default app from the Svelte website is confusing to use.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                The community is smaller, so there might not be as many
                resources available.
              </p>
            </li>
