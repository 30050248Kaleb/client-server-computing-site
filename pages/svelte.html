        <h2>Svelte</h2>
        <section style="display: flex; gap: 2rem">
          <div>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
              Svelte is a component framework built by Rich Harris. Svelte is
              different to most other frameworks, because instead of "diffing"
              the DOM, it compiles your code into efficent code that directly
              manipulates the DOM (Harris, 2019).
            </p>
            <h3>How it works</h3>
            <p>
              When trying out Svelte, I went to their website, which had an
              interactive tutorial to learn how Svelte's single file components
              work. I found this to be very helpful.
            </p>
            <p>
              I installed the default app from their website, which looked
              nothing like what I had just been learning, so I had to research
              into why there was pages that begun with plus symbols. It turns
              out they are how Svelte knows which components are routable. The
              pages don't have to be added to a list of routes anywhere, they're
              automatically picked up by the plus prefix, and then you can just
              navigate to the folder's path. The default Svelte app's entry
              point is app.html, which is in the src folder, the content of the
              body is injected into a div in the body specified by a Svelte
              variable called %sveltekit.body%.
            </p>
            <p>
              The components can have a script, style and HTML section, allowing
              for the HTML, CSS and JavaScript to be in the same file. The style
              is scoped to the component, so it doesn't affect the rest of the
              page, which can be useful if you don't live by the philosophy of
              reusing styles across components. When you reference a component,
              it looks like a custom HTML tag with the properties passed in as
              attributes.

          <h4>Strengths</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Svelte is a compiler, which means that it can be faster than a
                framework that uses a virtual DOM (Harris, 2019).
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Svelte is small, and it is easy to understand.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Components can have their own style, which is scoped to the
                component.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Routed components are automatically picked up, so you don't have
                to add them to a list of routes.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Referenced components are structured like HTML tags, which makes
                it easy to understand.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                There is a learning curve to get used to the syntax, and the way
                Svelte works.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                The default app from the Svelte website is confusing to use.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                The community is smaller, so there might not be as many
                resources available.

          <h3>Example Web App</h3>
          <p>
            I found Svelte to be simple to understand, but the syntax complex to
            learn. For example, the components you want routed have to be called
            +page.svelte inside a folder you want the route to be called. To
            create a template that all the pages can use, you have to create a
            +layout.svelte file, which can then be overriden by a +layout.svelte
            file in the folder of the page you want to override it for. The slot
            tag defines where the content of the page will be injected, so you
            can't have the navbar above the page title and below the page
            content if they are both in the actual +page.svelte file.
          </p>
          <p>
            For this framework I made a basic site that has routing, and two
            pages that have their content generated by sub-components that take
            in props and display information from a JSON file. The JSON contains
            data about DC and Marvel superheroes, and I use a component to
            generate a grid of cards that filter the type of publisher (Marvel
            or DC) and that component uses another to create a card with the
            information about the superhero and either a blue or red background
            depending on the publisher.
          </p>
          <p>
            As shown below, albeit out of order, the +layout.svelte, which I use
            to display the header and navigation bar, the index +page.svelte,
            which contains the content for the home page, and the +page.svelte
            for both the DC and Marvel pages, which are inside their own folders
            inside of a superheroes folder. They both import a component called
            CardGrid, which is used to generate the grid of cards, and in the
            script tag, the props for the publisher and publisher colour (which
            defines the colour of the cards) are passed in. This is demonstrated
            in the next file, CardGrid.svelte, which creates a card grid and
            creates the cards inside for each superhero in the JSON file if they
            match the correct publisher, using the HeroCard component. The
            HeroCard component takes in many props, which are defined by the
            superhero entry from the JSON file, which are then displayed in
            heading and paragraph tags in the card. The publisher colour is used
            to set the background colour of the card.</p>
