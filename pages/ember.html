            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
              EmberJS was created by Yehuda Katz, a member of the Rust Core
              Team, however, he lists himself as a co-creator of Ember on his
              own site (Katz, 2015). The framework uses Handlebars as its
              templating engine, which Katz also created (Katz, 2015).
            </p>
            <h3>How it works</h3>
            <p>
              The entry point for this is index.html, however, you can't see
              where the base template is injected. The body receives a class of
              ember-application by default, but it is added to it somewhere that
              I couldn't find. application.hbs is the base template, yet there
              is no reference to where it will be inserted.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ember uses a virtual DOM, which is good because they are more
              efficient than regular DOMs. This is because unlike regular DOMs,
              they clone the current DOM, make all the changes and then compare
              the two and only makes the changes where they differ.
            </p>
            <p>
              Templates that are routed are placed after/inside of
              application.hbs. If you would like to create a template for the
              home page to display after the application.hbs, it has to be
              called index, which isn't mentioned anywhere, and you aren't shown
              a way to automatically populate the navbar with the templates.

          <h3>Example Web App</h3>
          <p>
            Learning Ember was probably the most difficult of the frameworks I
            have tried so far. The documentation is not very good, and the
            jargon is confusing and inconsistent. I found it difficult to find a
            good example of the router setup, and the documentation for the
            router was not very helpful. I made a website with Ember that was
            similar to the first tutorial they offer, generating content for
            each item in an array. Instead of using a string array of two
            scientists, I used a JSON file I found on the internet that
            contained a list of all the enchantments in Minecraft. I followed
            the tutorial to create a dynamic alert linked to a button click
            event. To keep the site consistent with the others I've tested, I
            added a router that has a navigation bar that stays at the top of
            every page.
          </p>
          <p>
            The code example below is of the base template (application.hbs),
            the template for the enchantments view, and the enchantment list
            module. The enchantments view is placed under the outlet handlebar
            tag, and the enchantment-list module (which has to be named in kebab
            case, but referenced in pascal case) is referenced in the
            enchantment view, with data passed in from the view's JavaScript
            file. The enchantment-list module's JavaScript file also has a
            method that displays an alert with parameters inserted.
