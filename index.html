            <h3>What is Client-Server Computing</h3>
            <p>
              According to Motiso (2022), "A client-server model is a networking
              computing system design that illustrates a relationship between
              two or more computers, where the client computers request and
              receive services or resources from a powerful centralized server
              computer" (Motiso, 2022, para 3)
            </p>
            <p>See Figure 1 for a visual example of Client-Server Computing.</p>
            <p>
              Client-Server Computing distributes tasks between the client and a
              server. The client sends a request for information and the server
              returns a response. This allows many clients to connect to a
              central server and send requests for information, which the server
              can then respond to.
            </p>
            <p>
              A very common example of Client-Server Computing is the Internet.
              When you visit a website, your browser is the client and the
              server is the web server the website is hosted on. When you
              request a page, the web server responds with the page data, which
              can then be displayed by your web browser.

          <h3>Uses of Client-Server Computing</h3>
          <p>
            Client-Server Computing has many uses, such as Web Servers, Email
            Servers and File Servers. This is because they allow the data to be
            stored on the server, which can be accessed by many clients. This
            means that the server can handle a large number of clients, and the
            clients can access the data without having to store it locally. This
            is also why Client-Server Computing is used in the Internet, as it
            allows many clients to request the same data from a centralised
            server.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Why has Client-Server Computing evolved</h3>
          <p>
            There are many reasons Client-Server Computing has evolved, a few of
            them are:
          </p>

          <h4>Increase in Network Speeds</h4>
          <p>
            The increase in network speeds has allowed for faster request and
            response times between the client and server. This has allowed for
            more complex websites/web apps to be developed, and for more clients
            to be connected to the server.
          </p>

          <h4>Scalability</h4>
          <p>
            The fact that the Client-Server model only has to scale on the
            server side to handle the capacity of users means it can be easily
            adapted to handle more users. This is because the server can be
            scaled up by adding more servers to the network, which can then
            handle more clients.
          </p>

          <h4>Advances in Computer Resources</h4>
          <p>
            As computers have become increasingly complex and interconnected,
            the Client-Server model has become widely adopted. Clients aren't
            just "dumb terminals" anymore and can process a fair amount of data.
            There are different styles of Client-Server Computing, such as Thick
            and Thin Client Computing.
          </p>

          <h3>
            Advantages and Disadvantages of Different Client-Server
            Architectures
          </h3>
          <p>
            There are different ways to structure your client-server
            interactions. This is usually described in layers, the presentation
            layer being the user interface (what the user is presented with),
            the application layer which processes and calculates the data, and
            the data layer which stores and retrieves the data. Each
            client-server architecture has their advantages and disadvantages.
          </p>
          <h4>1 Tier Architecture</h4>
          <p>
            1 Tier Architecture is the most basic style of Client-Server
            Computing. It is where the client and server are on the same device.
            This makes the connection trustworthy as the presentation, business
            and data layer are all on your local machine, however, it can be
            difficult for the server to do all three tasks if there are a lot of
            users connected (Sugandhi, 2023). This kind of system is fine for a
            simple application that doesn't need to handle a lot of users, such
            as a local music player.
          </p>
          <h4>2 Tier Architecture</h4>
          <p>
            2 Tier Architecture is where the user interface is stored on the
            client system and the server stores the databases (Sugandhi, 2023).
            This means that many clients can all connect to the server and
            access the same data. The presentation layer is stored on the client
            and the data layer is stored on the server (Sugandhi, 2023). The
            application layer can either be stored on the client or the server.
            If it's on the client, it's called a "thick client" because the
            processing is done client-side, and if it's on the server, it's
            called a "thin client" because the server does the processing.
          </p>
          <div class="indent">
            <h4>Thick Client Computing</h4>
            <p>
              Thick Client Computing (also known as a desktop, fat or heavy
              client) is a style of Client-Server Computing in which the client
              does most of the processing and data storage client-side, even
              without a network (Parallels, 2021). This makes the client feel
              responsive and have better capability with a limited network
              connection and is ideal if the server is slow. However, it isn't
              recommended for mobile or remote clients, as they don't have the
              processing power or memory capacity to run complex actions.
            </p>
            <h4>Thin Client Computing</h4>
            <p>
              Thin Client Computing is another style of Client-Server Computing
              that relies mainly on a central server to connect to, to process
              data and store it. This is because the client is usually a mobile
              device, which is accessing the data from a remote location or
              doesn't have the processing power to do this (Parallels, 2021).
              This means that the client can be used anywhere, and the server
              can be scaled up to handle more clients.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            2 Tier Architecture is the fastest client-server architecture
            because the client and server are in direct communication with each
            other (Sugandhi, 2023). This architecture is useful for small
            websites where there is little processing of the data. 2 Tier
            Architecture isn't recommended for an app that needs to handle a lot
            of users and process the data they are sending, as it can slow the
            server down. Instead you would use a 3 Tier Architecture.
          </p>
          <h4>3 Tier Architecture</h4>
          <p>
            3 Tier Architecture is similar to 2 Tier Architecture, except the
            application layer is stored a different server to the database
            layer, so that both the client and server perform better (Sugandhi,
            2023). This approach can be used to make more complex applications,
            where you need to separate the data and the processing of the data
            so the server can handle more users retrieving data. This may be
            expensive and redundant for smaller applications and can lead to
            slower response times, as there are more servers to communicate
            with.
          </p>
          <h4>N Tier Architecture</h4>
          <p>
            N Tier Architecture, also known as multi-tier architecture is just
            like 3 Tier Architecture, except it separates one of the layers into
            multiple, to reduce the load on the server (Sugandhi, 2023). This
            could be splitting the application layer to have a caching layer,
            which stores data that is frequently accessed, so the server doesn't
            have to process it every time, or it could be a security layer,
            which checks the data before it is sent to the server. While this
            architecture seems like a good idea, it can be difficult to
            implement and maintain, as it can be both complicated and expensive
            to set up and maintain multiple servers.

        <h2>Single Pages Applications (SPAs)</h2>
        <section>
          <h3>What is a SPA</h3>
          <p>
            A Single Page Application (SPA) is a web application that only uses
            a single HTML page to display content. When a user navigates to a
            different page on the app, the page isn't reloaded, instead,
            javascript is used to update the HTML page and injects the new
            content into the page. Since the entire page isn't reloaded on
            navigation, the app feels more responsive. Parts of the site that
            are consistent across pages, such as the navigation bar, can be
            injected into the base HTML page, so it doesn't have to be copied
            and pasted into every page, which makes it easier to update. An
            example of a SPA is Gmail, which only uses a single HTML page to
            display content.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>History and Philosophy of SPAs</h3>
          <p></p>
          <h4>History of the SPA</h4>
          <p>
            The origins of the SPA are unknown, but an early concept of one was
            Stuart Morris' "Self-Contained Website" called slashdotslash in 2002
            (Shvartzman, 2014). Technology similar to the modern SPA was also
            described later in 2002 in a US patent entitled "Delivery of data
            and formatting information to allow client-side manipulation" by
            Lucas Birdeau, Clifford Yeh, Michael Peachey and Kevin Hakman (Ćwik,
            2021).
          </p>
          <h4>Philosophy of SPAs</h4>
          <p>
            Single Page Applications are centered around the idea of a
            simplistic, responsive and interactive user experience. This is to
            make the site seem as seamless as possible, just like an app. Single
            Page Applications are designed to be fast and reactive, so that the
            user can interact with the site without having to wait for each page
            to load. This also means once the app loads, it can be used offline,
            as the all data is stored on the client (Churylov, 2023). They are
            also designed to be quick to develop, because you can reuse most of
            the code across the app. With traditional sites, complete pages have
            to be generated for thousands of users, but with SPAs, the renderign
            is all done client-side, making the server respond faster (Churylov,
            2023).
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>How they work</h3>
          <p>
            SPAs use a base HTML page to load the structure of the app and then
            injects components into the parts of the page using javascript. This
            is done by using a router to determine which component injects
            where. Dynamically swapping out the elements of a singular web page
            gives the illusion of a seamless and responsive site akin to a
            mobile app. SPAs typically use a framework to make this process
            easier, as they have built-in tools to make the development simpler.
            An example of a SPA framework is React, which has a built-in router,
            which is an easy way to route views and components to different
            URLs.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>How they differ from traditional web development</h3>
          <p>
            Traditional web development usually consists of designing a site
            page by page, which can have you copy and pasting elements like the
            navigation bar into every page, so when you go to modify it, you
            have to change every instance of it. Whereas with SPA development,
            you can create a navigation bar in a component and then reference it
            where you need it, so when you need to modify it, you only have to
            update the component.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Technologies SPAs make use of</h3>
          <p></p>
          <h4>HTML, CSS and Javascript/Typescript</h4>
          <p>
            HTML, CSS and Javascript are the building blocks with which the vast
            majority of websites are built. SPAs are no different, and use these
            technologies to create the structure, visual design and
            functionality of the app.
          </p>
          <h4>REST APIs</h4>
          <p>
            REST APIs are used to communicate with the server and retrieve data.
            This is done by sending HTTP requests to the server, which then
            responds with the data in the form of a JSON object. This data is
            then used to update the HTML page.
          </p>
          <h4>Server-Side Frameworks</h4>
          <p>
            Server-side frameworks are used to create the server that the SPA
            communicates with. This is done by creating a server that can handle
            HTTP requests and respond with the data in the form of a JSON
            object. Frameworks can benefits SPAs by potentially improving
            performance and security
          </p>
          <h4>URLs</h4>
          <p>
            Erwin states that underlying technologies that SPAs use like URLs
            are often artificially injected by the browser's History API; this
            seems like a hybrid state instead of a long-term solution. The
            concept of URLs makes sense for document-based websites but needs to
            be rethought from the perspective of SPAs. If not taken care of,
            simple features like the forward and back buttons can break the app,
            resulting in a bad user experience (Erwin, 2021).
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Strengths and Weaknesses</h3>
          <p></p>
          <h4>Strengths</h4>
          <p>
            SPAs seem faster and more responsive than typical websites because
            the entire page isn't reloaded anytime a request is made from the
            client. Page elements like the header and footer can be reused
            across many pages, eliminating inconsistencies that could arise when
            you forget to update certain instances of them in a traditional
            website. Reusable components also reduce the development time of
            sites, because you aren't updating each instance of it when
            implementing new features.
          </p>
          <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
          <p>
            Most SPAs aren't supported on older browsers and/or browsers that
            don't support javascript, this can drive away certain groups of
            people, as they can't view any part of your site. They also can be
            difficult for search engines to index, meaning your site might not
            appear on a search engine like Google, which will make it harder to
            find your site.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Business Problems They Are Best Suited To Solve</h3>
          <p>
            SPAs are best suited for sites that are data-driven, such as real
            estate sites or online stores. This is because they can be easily
            updated to display a lot of information which can be formatted by a
            template. They are also suited for keeping the flow, for example:
            stores where you can browse the store, add items to your cart and
            then checkout without having to reload the page once.

          <h3>What is a REST API</h3>
          <p>
            A Representational State Transfer API (REST API) is an application
            programming interface (API) that allows data to be transmitted over
            a standardised protocol interface like HTML (for web applications)
            or SMTP (for email uses) for example, while conforming to the REST
            architectural principals. REST APIs are used to perform the four
            basic CRUD operations: create, read, update and delete.

          <h3>Characteristics of a REST API</h3>
          <p></p>
          <h4>Resource-Based</h4>
          <p>
            REST APIs are resource-based, so the URLs used are based on the
            resource rather than the action taken. This means the URL is the
            same for all the different actions that can be taken on the
            resource. For example, the URL for a data entry is the same for when
            you are creating, viewing, editing or deleting the page. This makes
            the URLs easier to understand and remember.
          </p>

          <h4>Stateless</h4>
          <p>
            REST APIs are stateless, which means that each request contains all
            the information needed to complete the request. This means that the
            server doesn't store any information about the client, which means
            every request is independent of the previous request (Red Hat,
            2020).
          </p>

          <h4>Cacheable</h4>
          <p>
            REST APIs are cacheable (Red Hat, 2020), which means that the server
            can cache a response to a request, so that if the same request is
            made, it can just return the already cached response, allowing the
            server to use its resources more efficiently, responding to other
            requests.
          </p>

          <h3>How REST can be used in SPA Development</h3>
          <p>
            REST APIs can be used in SPA development to provide the data for the
            SPA. The SPA can then use the data to display the content to the
            user. REST APIs can also be used to perform CRUD operations on the
            data.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Where REST can be used in SPA Development</h3>
          <p>
            REST APIs can be used to retrieve data from a database and display
            it to the user. They can also be used to handle the user's
            authentication and include their access token in the API requests.
            REST APIs can also be used to perform CRUD operations on the data
            received from the database.

          <h3>Considerations when using a REST API as a SPA solution</h3>
          <p></p>
          <h4>Authentication</h4>
          <p>
            If you decide to use a REST API as a SPA solution, you will need to
            consider how you will handle authentication. If your REST API
            contains sensitive data, you will need to consider how to
            authenticate users to ensure that only authorised users can access
            the data.
          </p>
          <h4>Authorisation</h4>
          <p>
            Another consideration to make is how you will authorise people to
            constrain their access to CRUD operations. For example, if you are
            to use a REST API as a SPA solution for a blog, you will need to
            consider how you will authorise people to create, read, update and
            delete blog posts.
          </p>
          <h4>Security</h4>
          <p>
            Your REST API will need to be secure, so that it can't be tampered
            with, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. XSS attacks are
            when a malicious script is injected into an otherwise safe website,
            which can be used to steal data or perform other malicious actions
            such as stealing session cookies (Veracode, n.d.).
          </p>
          <h4>Versioning</h4>
          <p>
            When using a REST API for your SPA, you might want to make an update
            to your API, however, if the changes break the older version, people
            who use your API will need to update their code, which can be a lot
            of work. To avoid this, you can use versioning, which allows you to
            make changes to your API without breaking the older version. This
            means that people who use your API can continue to use the older
            version until they are ready to update their code to use the newer
            version.
